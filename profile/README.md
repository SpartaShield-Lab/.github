🛡️ SpartaShield Lab — Cybersecurity with Attitude
SpartaShield Lab is a next-gen experimental cybersecurity project born in chaos and powered by code.

We're not your average antivirus company. We don’t wear ties. We build custom tools, scanners, traps, and digital defenses — forged in memes, tested in virtual battlefields, and sharpened by caffeine.

🔹 Real protection, zero boredom.

🔹 Made for devs, by a dev.

🔹 Open to chaos. Closed to malware.

From custom threat scanners to meme-grade UI with military-grade backbone — SpartaShield Lab is your digital hoplite in the war against cyber threats.
